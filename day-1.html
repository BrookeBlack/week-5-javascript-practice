  <h1>Templates</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">Read more about
      templates here.</a>
  </p>

  <p>We know about variables. We know about Strings. We will now learn about But how to we put them together?</p>
  <p> We use backticks and ${ }. Have a look at an example</p>

  <h2>Example 1</h2>
  <p>Lets look at some variables and write them out in a string.</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let playerName;
      playerName = "John";
      document.write(`Hi, ${playerName}. Welcome to the game!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let dinnerItem;
      dinnerItem = "Lasagna";
      document.write(`We are having ${dinnerItem}, tonight!`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let fruit;
      fruit = "strawberry";
      document.write(`It's ${fruit} season.`)
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Example 2</h2>
  <p>You can have as many variables as you want. You can even use numbers!</p>
  <p>
    <script>
      let a;
      let b;
      let c;

      a = 12;
      b = 3;
      c = a + b;
      document.write(`${a} plus ${b} is equal to ${c}.`)
    </script>
  </p>
  <p>
    <script>
      c = a * b;
      document.write(`${a} times ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <p>
    <script>
      a = 512;
      b = 64;
      c = a / b;
      document.write(`${a} divided by ${b} is equal to ${c}`);
    </script>
  </p>

  <h2>Try it!</h2>
  <p>Now you try it!</p>
  <p>Make at least 5 more examples of templates yourself.</p>


<p>
  <p>my try number 1</p>
<script>
let animal;
let phrase;
animal = "Dogs";
phrase    = "man's best friend.";
document.write(` ${animal} are ${phrase}`);
</script>
</p>

<p>
<p>my try number 2</p>
<script>
let item;
let time;
item = "clock";
time = "6 o'clock";
document.write(` Class starts when the ${item} says ${time}`);
</script>
</p>

<p>
<p>my try number 3</p>
<script>
let color;
let name;
color = blue;
name = Gabriel;
document.write(`${name} has a favorite color and it's ${color}!`);
</script>
</p>

<p>
<p>my try number 4</p>
<script>
let x;
let y;
let z;
x = 2;
y = 3;
z = 5;
document.write(`${z} equals ${y} plus ${x}.`)
</script>
</p>

<p>
<p>my try number 5</p>
<script>
let money;
let nametwo;
money = $5;
nametwo = Sara;
document.write(`${nametwo} has ${money} to spend on candy.`)
</script>
</p>
